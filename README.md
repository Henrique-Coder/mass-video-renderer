<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

Transcodash is a smart CLI tool for optimal media transcoding. It analyzes your computer and the input media files, generating and executing an optimal FFmpeg command for efficient conversion with no visible loss of quality.

- **Feautures**
  - **Easy to use**: just run the CLI tool in your terminal, provide the required information and let Transcodash do the rest.
  - **99% Automatic**: automatically understands and detects the best transcoding settings and parameters for locally installed FFmpeg. The only three required items you will need to manually provide Transcodash are the input and output file directory and the video codec!
  - **Smart**: this tool doesn't rely on the generic/common to generate the command, instead it has a great deal of complexity internally and makes use of every detail of the metadata of the source media file you choose and understands what the best arguments might be for each video/audio.
  - **Optimal**: the generated command is designed for fast, efficient conversion with no visible loss of quality.
  - **Customizable**: you can add extra arguments to the command if you want and let Transcodash perform the task. Or, you can just copy the command generated by Transcodash, modify it and use it however you prefer and wherever you want.
  - **Cross-platform**: works on Windows 7, 8.1, 10 and 11 (Linux and macOS support coming soon).
  - **Free and Open Source**: this tool is free to use and open source, so you can contribute to the project and help it grow.


- **Why Transcodash?**
  - **Saves time**: no need to spend hours researching the best FFmpeg command for your media files.
  - **Saves effort**: no need to manually generate the command, just run the tool and let it do the work.
  - **Saves money**: no need to pay for expensive software to convert your media files.
  - **Saves quality**: it generates the best command for optimal conversion with no visible loss of quality.
  - **Saves space**: you will have the best command for the best compression rate, saving space on your storage.
